REF: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39281594/error-1698-28000-access-denied-for-user-rootlocalhost

The reason is that recent Ubuntu installation (maybe others also), mysql is using by default the UNIX auth_socket plugin.

Basically means that: db_users using it, will be "auth" by the system user credentias. You can see if your root user is set up like this by doing the following:

$ sudo mysql -u root # I had to use "sudo" since is new installation

mysql> USE mysql;
mysql> SELECT User, Host, plugin FROM mysql.user;

+------------------+-----------------------+
| User             | plugin                |
+------------------+-----------------------+
| root             | auth_socket           |
| mysql.sys        | mysql_native_password |
| debian-sys-maint | mysql_native_password |
+------------------+-----------------------+
As you can see in the query, the root user is using the auth_socket plugin

There are 2 ways to solve this:

You can set the root user to use the mysql_native_password plugin
You can create a new db_user with you system_user (recommended)
Option 1:

$ sudo mysql -u root # I had to use "sudo" since is new installation

mysql> USE mysql;
mysql> UPDATE user SET plugin='mysql_native_password' WHERE User='root';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> exit;

$ service mysql restart
Option 2: (replace YOUR_SYSTEM_USER with the username you have)

$ sudo mysql -u root # I had to use "sudo" since is new installation

mysql> USE mysql;
mysql> CREATE USER 'YOUR_SYSTEM_USER'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'YOUR_SYSTEM_USER'@'localhost';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> exit;

$ service mysql restart
Remember that if you use option #2 you'll have to connect to mysql as your system username (mysql -u YOUR_SYSTEM_USER)
