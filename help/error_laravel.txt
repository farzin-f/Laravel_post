1.
php artisan make:migration create_tasks_table --create=tasks
error: failed to open stream: No such file or directory
solution: composer dump-autoload

2.
phpMyAdmin AllowNoPassword:
  - sudo emacs -nw /etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php
  - uncomment this:
    $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPasswordRoot'] = true;

3. Reading from DB:
  error: htmlspecialchars() expects parameter 1 to be string, object given4 ...
  That's because DB::table()->get() returns a JSON object. So we should define
  the right field (e.g. task->body)

4. Inside tinker:
error: BadMethodCallException with message 'Call to undefined method
Illuminate\Database\Query\Builder::incomplete()'
soluction: exit tinker and reenter it

5. CSRF:
error: TokenMismatchException
solution: include {{ csrf_field() }} inside form tag

6. namespace problem:
error: Class 'App\Http\Controllers\App\Post' not found
solution: should use the right namespace; e.g. use App\Post;

7. create()
error: MassAssignmentException
solution: that is because we didn't give permission the fields that are going
to be filled inside create() method. We should use either fillable() or guarded()
inside model class.

8. General error, requested page not found, etc, restarts the server might fix it

9. If nothing is stored in DB while the form has no error, be sure to include
attribut name for your inputs inside form.

10. attempt(): this method hashes the password by default	so if the password is
stored in plaintext in server it would fail!
